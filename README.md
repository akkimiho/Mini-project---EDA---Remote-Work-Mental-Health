About Dataset
As remote work becomes the new norm, it's essential to understand its impact on employees' mental well-being. 
This dataset dives into how working remotely affects stress levels, work-life balance, and mental health conditions across various industries and regions.
With 5,000 records collected from employees worldwide, this dataset provides valuable insights into key areas like work location (remote, hybrid, onsite), stress levels, access to mental health resources, and job satisfaction. Itâ€™s designed to help researchers, HR professionals, and businesses assess the growing influence of remote work on productivity and well-being. ðŸŒ¿ðŸ“ˆ

Columns in dataset:

-  Employee_ID: Unique identifier for each employee.
-  Age: Age of the employee.
-  Gender: Gender of the employee.
-  Job_Role: Current role of the employee.
-  Industry: Industry they work in.
-  Work_Location: Whether they work remotely, hybrid, or onsite.
-  Stress_Level: Their self-reported level of stress.
-  Mental_Health_Condition: Any mental health condition reported (Anxiety, Depression, etc.).
-  Social_Isolation_Rating: A self-reported rating (1-5) on how isolated they feel.
-  Satisfaction_with_Remote_Work: How satisfied they are with remote work arrangements (Satisfied, Neutral, Unsatisfied).

## Problem Formulation:
### Company has observed a rising concern regarding the mental well-being of our remote workforce. Specifically, there appear to be increased stress levels, reports of social isolation, and overall dissatisfaction with work-life balance. These factors may negatively influence productivity, team morale, and ultimately, employee retention.

### To address these concerns, company require a comprehensive analysis to uncover the root causes and identify key drivers behind these trends. Additionally, we are interested in determining if specific roles, age groups, or genders are particularly affected, as well as exploring the influence of regional and departmental differences.

Tasks:
1.Identify Factors Affecting Stress Levels
2.Examine Satisfaction with Work-Life Balance
3.Investigate the extent of social isolation reported by employees and identify which work arrangements (remote, hybrid, onsite) are linked with higher isolation ratings.
4.Identify At-Risk Groups:highlight any patterns of stress or dissatisfaction by age, gender, or department to ensure tailored support can be provided where needed.
